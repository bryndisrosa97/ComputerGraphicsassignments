Computer Graphics assignments


The main emphasis of the course was on the fundamental concepts and mathematics for three-dimensional computer graphics. This included two-dimensional and three-dimensional transformations, perspective projection, lighting and shading of objects, texture mapping, blending, bump mapping, programmable shading, paths, and surfaces. Programming tasks were carried out in WebGL.

Upon completing this course, I have gained:

Understanding of the main characteristics of modern graphic hardware.
Knowledge of the mathematical transformations used in computer graphics.
Ability to write Javascript programs using WebGL to display and work with three-dimensional models.
Familiarity with the main methods used in three-dimensional computer graphics, such as perspective projection, overlays, exponential models, coloring, and texture mapping.
Ability to write simple shaders in the GLSL shading language.

a WebGL program to simulate the rotation of the planet Mars and its moons around the sun. The moons are two, Phobos and Deimos, and they rotate at different speeds around Mars. The moons always show the same side to Mars, but Phobos rotates about 4 times faster around Mars than Deimos, as Phobos is on a lower orbit

three.js program with a sphere, a  bottle, and a floor. The sphere should rotate in a circle and thus pass through the hole in the bottle.

In this project, I enhanced a program called 20-point-light-shadowmap. I implemented two point light sources, both casting shadows and visible with PointLightHelpers. I further created a user interface allowing the location of each light source to be adjusted interactively. Additionally, I programmed movements for the cube and sphere in the 3D scene. I configured the sphere to oscillate vertically in a fixed location and the cube to move linearly back and forth.
