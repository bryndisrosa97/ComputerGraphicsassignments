Computer Graphics assignments


The main emphasis of the course was on the fundamental concepts and mathematics for three-dimensional computer graphics. This included two-dimensional and three-dimensional transformations, perspective projection, lighting and shading of objects, texture mapping, blending, bump mapping, programmable shading, paths, and surfaces. Programming tasks were carried out in WebGL.

Upon completing this course, I have gained:

Understanding of the main characteristics of modern graphic hardware.
Knowledge of the mathematical transformations used in computer graphics.
Ability to write Javascript programs using WebGL to display and work with three-dimensional models.
Familiarity with the main methods used in three-dimensional computer graphics, such as perspective projection, overlays, exponential models, coloring, and texture mapping.
Ability to write simple shaders in the GLSL shading language.
